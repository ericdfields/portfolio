Hey. I’m Eric. I’m a human who designs and builds user experiences for the web that are easy to use, accessible, and intuitively functional.

A lot of what I’ve built in the past 8 or so years has been for my employer, and the stuff that I helped build before that is… [hard to find](https://www.linkedin.com/company/boundless-learning/ "We were so ahead of the curve back then").

So I can only show you so much, but we’ll make do.
